## Log Insights useful queries

TODO: add them as pre-defined queries in the log insights console through SAM:

### Lambda execution billed duration

```plain
filter @type = "REPORT"
| stats
  avg(@billedDuration) as Average,
  percentile(@billedDuration, 99) as NinetyNinth,
  percentile(@billedDuration, 95) as NinetyFifth,
  percentile(@billedDuration, 90) as Ninetieth
by bin(30m)
```
